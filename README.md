TennisComp is a web-based platform designed to help tennis players create profiles, track their matches, and compare skill levels through a player rating system.
Inspired by the UTR platform, this project allows users to register, log in, and view personalized profiles that display performance data and competitive rankings.

The goal of this project is to simulate a real-world competitive tennis environment while demonstrating full-stack web-development concepts.
